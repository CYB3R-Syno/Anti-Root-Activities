# Write up
The zip file was decompressed first.   
I was able to obtain the cpt file through unzip.

The configuration was confirmed through the tree command.

The file seems important in a total of three things. 
- hiddddddeeennnnn_properlyyy.obb
- WhatsApp Chat with SECRET_DISCUSSIONS.txt
- whatsapp.zip.cpt

I checked the file on the obb first.
```
[19:04:48] [~/Desktop/Tamil_Forensic/Chat with me/Android/obb] ‚ù±‚ù±‚ù± file hiddddddeeennnnn_properlyyy.obb 
hiddddddeeennnnn_properlyyy.obb: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compression method=deflate
[19:04:50] [cost 0.039s] file hiddddddeeennnnn_properlyyy.obb      
```

I thought it was an obb file, but I can see that it is a zip file and a password is hung.   

Second, we checked SECRET_DISCUSSIONS.txt.

The password is not here. 
So I used **fcrackzip**.    
I was able to get a password through fcrackzip. ```samantha.```

After that, the unzip was conducted.
```

‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(rootüíÄ705875b5fe6e)-[~/Downloads]
‚îî‚îÄ# unzip hiddddddeeennnnn_properlyyy.obb 
Archive:  hiddddddeeennnnn_properlyyy.obb
[hiddddddeeennnnn_properlyyy.obb] get_password.py password: 
  inflating: get_password.py   
  ```    

We were able to obtain the get_password.py file and confirmed that a format similar to Flag appeared when running.

But later, we found out that this was the password for the cpt file, not the flag.
After that, we looked at cpt encryption.

Search Keyword ```cpt file encryption```

I was able to know about crypto and continued to solve the problem using ```ccrypt```.   
I decompressed it and I was able to get a normal zip file.

Also, when I decompressed the zip file, there were files similar to the first files I saw.

I was able to see the WhatsApp\ Chat\ with\ GIMME\ FLAG\ VROO.txt file and read it myself.

(Please understand that the first part that was cut off was created and checked by creating a new text file.)

I was able to check again that the sticker folder had a file and moved on to the sticker folder.
Strings were checked through the strings command in the STK-20210804-WA0136.webp file.

{"sticker-pack-id":"com.snowcorp.stickerly.android.stickercontentprovider 5661e2d0-bfcd-40e6-8fed-7f91e43735c5","sticker-pack-link":"https://sticker.ly/s/<sticker-pack-code>","sticker-pack-code":"3HCM91","sticker-pack-publisher":"Sticker.ly * jopraveen","android-app-store-link":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.snowcorp.stickerly.android","ios-app-store-link":"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/app\/id1458740001?mt=8"}
```
This part was very eye-catching and looked special.
```
"sticker-pack-link":"https://sticker.ly/s/<sticker-pack-code>"
```
That's why I connected it and they said they need a sticker pack code after url.
Also, the sticker pack code was written on the right back row.
```
"sticker-pack-code":"3HCM91"
```
Now, let's enter url and sticker pack code to access.
If you check the site title after connecting, you were able to obtain a flag.

Flag is ```TamilCTF{7h4ts_4_n1c3_st1ck3r}```
